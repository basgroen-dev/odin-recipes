    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pasta Carbonara is a classic Italian dish made with spaghetti tossed in a rich, creamy sauce made from eggs, Parmesan cheese, pancetta or guanciale, and black pepper. The heat from the pasta cooks the eggs, creating a silky coating without the use of cream. It's a simple yet flavorful dish, known for its indulgent texture and savory taste.
